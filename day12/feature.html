        With Simple.Savr, all you have to do is copy & paste your text into Simple.Savr, or upload 
        files, and visit Simple.Savr from any device 
        that is under the same WiFi network.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> No more emailing yourself a file to get it to another device
        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> No more memorizing that long URL to open it on another computer
        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>No more copying that file using a USB just to get that text or file over to another device.
                   
        After uploading files or saving your savr from one device, your data will be waiting for you 
        from all your devices.</pre>

                <p>
                    Simple.Savr works on all platforms. Our responsive design makes everything 
                    clean and very simple</p>
                  <i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i> 
                  <H3>PASSWORD PROTECTION  </H3>
                  <p>You can protect your savr using a password. This way, if someone else get's
                     on your WiFi network, they can't see your savr, uploaded files and settings</p>
                     <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i>
                     <h3>100% ENCRYPTED</h3>
                     <p>Even we can't see what you have typed. That's how secure your savr is.
                         Your savr is encrypted using your IP and an encryption text that is 
                         randomly generated which you can override by providing your own.</p>
                         <i class="fa-solid fa-paperclip"></i>
                         <h3>UPLOAD FILES</h3>
                         <p>You can now upload and sync files automatically across all your 
                            devices. No more emailing that document to your other computer just to print it.</p>

                            <h3>LINK MULTIPLE IPS</h3>
                            <p>Do the computers on your network have two different IPs? Not a problem, 
                                just add tha IP address from settings and active it from a device that 
                                is under the IP you just added. There you go, now you have multiple IPs 
                                synced together!</p>

                            <P>We don't like ads either. No one does. Except advertisers and of course,
                                 Google. That's why we give you the option to remove them from your 
                                 settings. If you disable ads, it will be disabled from all your devices.</P>
